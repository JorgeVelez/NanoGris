Format: ![images of the red NanoGrids](url)

Made this version  with Thru Hole parts and a Arduino Nano.
Schematics are heavely based on Mutable Instruments schematics.

_Note: panel hole for button might be a bit to big or small (depends if you use buttoncaps)_

I made this for my own and would like to share it with you. I'm doing this as a hobby so expect support to be like that to ;)
Everything at your own risk..
