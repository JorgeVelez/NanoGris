# NanoGrids
### Arduino Nano version of Mutable Instruments Grids

Made this version  with Thru Hole parts and a Arduino Nano.
Schematics are heavely based on Mutable Instruments schematics. This is not a Mutable Instuments product.

_Note: panel hole for button might be a bit to big or small (depends if you use buttoncaps)_

I made this for my own and would like to share it with you. I'm doing this as a hobby so expect support to be like that to ;)
Everything at your own risk..

Update: 6-8-2021
I updated the name of the module. The current version is 0.041

Older boards will have the same function. Did add some better ground planes. Some silkscreen additions to make build easier and changed the footprint of the potentiometer for better fit.
